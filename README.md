  ## Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

  * The Team-Generator is a CLI application that runs on NODE JS. It prompts the user a menu with options to add any number of team members. The person using the program can add managers, engineers and interns. Once done, the user can select the option "Exit" and this will generate a new html document with the user input. The html file is name team.html and it contains the template with the user input information. If the user desired to delete the html template from the CLI, it is as simple as selecting the "Clear all" option.

  
  * Installation: To use Team-Generator you must have node installed in your computer. NPM packages required are ‘Inquirer’ and ‘Path’.


  * Usage: Download and install on desired folder. Open the command window and type node index.js to run the program.
